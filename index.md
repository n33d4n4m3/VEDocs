# Welcome to the VanillaEvents Documentation.

---

This wiki aims to fully document the VanillaEvents (VE) datapack - including all event types that have already been added and those that are only planned so far.

The following pages might be useful for you, if you
- want to use a datapack that requires VE, and you need help installing VE in your world. -> [Installation](test)
- develop a datapack in which you want to make use of VE's events. -> [Accessing Events](test)
- want to fork the project to add your own events -> [Build pon](test)
- want to contribute to VE. -> [Onboarding](test)

If you just want to learn about events and data you can extract from them, the Events page is a good start. -> [Events](Events)
