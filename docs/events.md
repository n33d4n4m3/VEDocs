# Events

---

The documentation should provide the following information for each event:

- the complete description of the event source
a sorted overview of all data collected by an event and how it can be retrieved
- Properties of the event, such as whether it is fired synchronously or asyncronously, or whether it can be canceled or modified.
- Configuration options of the event
